# landclass

This repository contains the R code for the main steps used in the methodology of the journal article ....

1. Stepwise instructions for classification of sentinel 2A imagery  into eight land types in upland UK watersheds.
2. Models for simulating woodland creation scenarios

The image classification process is adapted from an online tutorial by Valentin Stefan available at:

discuss the ras to vect to rast conversion issues and re - adding base woodland map and adjusting the % increase calculations
